### Part 2 Twitter 

When testing twitter, I had two tests failed. 

I figured that the issue was coming from the isMentionned method. 

Then I changed the isMentionned method in Twitter.java, after the modification, all tests passed. 

Please see the picture named "2 tests FAILED and "All TESTS PASSED". 

You can see the modification of isMentionned under twitter.java.
